> Proxy to you bee node which aims to work as a public or personal gateway or to be used in CI for uploading to Swarm.

**Warning: This project is in beta state. There might (and most probably will) be changes in the future to its API and
working. Also, no guarantees can be made about its stability, efficiency, and security at this stage.**

This project is intended to be used with
**Bee&nbsp;version&nbsp;<!-- SUPPORTED_BEE_START -->1.7.0-bbf13011<!-- SUPPORTED_BEE_END -->**. Using it with older or
newer Bee versions is not recommended and may not work. Stay up to date by joining the
[official Discord](https://discord.gg/GU22h2utj6) and by keeping an eye on the
[releases tab](https://github.com/ethersphere/gateway-proxy/releases).

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ethersphere/gateway-proxy.git
cd gateway-proxy
```

## Usage

The proxy can manage postage stamps for you in 4 modes of operation:

1. It can just proxy requests without manipulating the request
2. It can add/replace the request postage stamp with one provided through environment variable `POSTAGE_STAMP`
3. It can add/replace the request postage stamp with an auto-bought stamp or existing stamp that fulfils the amount,
   depth and is not too full or about to expire. To enable this, provide at minimum `POSTAGE_DEPTH`, `POSTAGE_AMOUNT`
   and `BEE_DEBUG_API_URL`.
4. It can extend the TTL of a stamp that is about to expire. To enable this, set `POSTAGE_EXTENDSTTL=true`,
   provide `POSTAGE_AMOUNT`, `POSTAGE_DEPTH` with the desired amount to use and `POSTAGE_TTL_MIN` above with
   a number above or equal to 60.

In modes 1, 2 and 3, the proxy can be configured to require authentication secret to forward the requests. Use the
`AUTH_SECRET` environment variable to enable it.

### Bzz.link support

Gateway proxy has support for Bzz.link which allows translating
[Swarm CIDs](https://github.com/ethersphere/swarm-cid-js) and ENS names placed under subdomains into `/bzz` call. This
allows to have better security model for your web applications.

In order to use Bzz.link, set the `HOSTNAME` environment variable, and either or both of `CID_SUBDOMAINS` and
`ENS_SUBDOMAINS` according to your requirements. You may also need to set up DNS with wildcard subdomain support.

### Reupload pinned content

It can reupload existing pinned content that appear as not retrievable. To enable this, provide `REAUPLOAD_PERIOD`
with the miliseconds that represent the time to periodicaly check pinned content status.

### Examples

#### 1. No postage stamp

```sh
npm run start
```

#### 2. Hardcoded postage stamp

```sh
export POSTAGE_STAMP=f1e4ff753ea1cb923269ed0cda909d13a10d624719edf261e196584e9e764e50

npm run start
```

#### 3. Autobuy postage stamps

```sh
export POSTAGE_DEPTH=20
export POSTAGE_AMOUNT=1000000
export BEE_DEBUG_API_URL=http://localhost:1635

npm run start
```

#### 4. Extends stamps TTL

```sh
export POSTAGE_EXTENDSTTL=true
export POSTAGE_TTL_MIN=60
export POSTAGE_DEPTH=20
export POSTAGE_AMOUNT=1000000
export BEE_DEBUG_API_URL=http://localhost:1635

npm run start
```

#### Reupload pinned content

```sh
export REUPLOAD_PERIOD=30000

npm run start
```

#### Enable authentication

```sh
export AUTH_SECRET="this_is_some_secret_string"

npm run start
```

  want to give feedback

### Local development with Bzz.link

Local development with the subdomain Bzz.link support is a bit more tricky as it requires to have a way how to direct local subdomains to given URL.

Easy way is to have one testing CID that you will put directly to `/etc/hosts` and use only that for testing.

```
bah5acgzamh5fl7emnrazttpy7sag6utq5myidv3venspn6l5sevr4lko2n3q.localhost 127.0.0.1
```

If you want fully functional setup than you have to locally install some DNS client that will provide you this functionality.
See for example [here](https://serverfault.com/a/118589) for `dnsmasq` solution.
